The AI behind much of the wackiness in the Crpyto Colosseum is Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3).  It is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

We use the GPT-3 to generate the descriptions of each round of combat based on the numbers that were calculated.

We also use it for some fun trash talking from each gladiator before the match.

GPT-3 is also used to help generate each gladiators history, special moves and attributes.

The GPT-3 content in the creation of gladiators is shared with the community during the process, which is then in turn fed back into GPT-3.  This brings our community together with the AI that is helping build the wacky world of the Crypto Colosseum.  It is an act of co-creation.
