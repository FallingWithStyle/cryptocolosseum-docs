Crypto Colosseum is built on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), a L2 commitchain of Ethereum. The in-game currency is Prestige ($PTG). Playing Crypto Colosseum does not require you to buy $PTG nor have $MATIC on the network (we use gasless transactions), but if you'd like to buy $PTG here's how. The app will offer you either a Torus wallet or Metamask when you sign up (it says 'Traditional Login' or 'Web3 login'). Either choice is fine and similar from here on out.

### Notes

You may have noticed your [game wallet](https://arena.cryptocolosseum.com/wallet) has a different address than your Metamask/Torus wallet. That's because we deploy what's called a [smart contract wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/) for you that lets you use the game without having to pay for gas (but everything is still *fully* in your control).

## Already have a Polygon wallet and tokens on Polygon?

Easy peasy. Swap here: https://app.slingshot.finance/trade/m/WPTG/MATIC and send the WPTG to your game wallet. You can also swap directly in the [game wallet](https://arena.cryptocolosseum.com/wallet) with several tokens (click 'Get more PTG').

## Have tokens on Ethereum?

You can easily move value from Ethereum -> Polygon using [Hyphen](https://hyphen.biconomy.io/) or the official [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge). If you need a little $MATIC to move things around there is a [faucet available](https://macncheese.finance/matic-polygon-mainnet-faucet.php) which will give you enough to make a couple of transactions. 

## Have crypto on a centralized exchange?

If you have any crypto in a centralized exchange then [Hippodrome](https://hippodrome.cryptocolosseum.com/) makes it easy to get $PTG. The simplest thing is to is to click 'Get more PTG' and then follow the link to Hippodrome.

## Are you an advanced DeFi User?

You can actually get $PTG for free using [QiDAO](https://app.mai.finance/). The basic idea is to open a vault with your crypto, take a negative interest loan and turn that into $PTG.
