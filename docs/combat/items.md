There are four different types of items available in Crypto Colosseum.
The four categories (currently) are potions, scrolls, oils and dusts.  There are three levels of rarity for each type in the current set of items.

More items will be created as the game continues to evolve.

Some items help gladiators by increasing their stats or health.  Other items, often referred to as _curses_, decrease their stats or health.

All items _currently_ are purchased for a specific gladiator and apply to a single tournament.  Shortly players will be able to purchase items had keep them in their wallets for use when they are most critical.  Each new item will be put on a bonding curve and the price will fluctuate based on market demand.  This means an astute player can invest and then resell powerful items as they are released.

:::tip
Note that any items applied are reset for each round within the tournament.  So a potion drunk during the first round is available again for the finals.

Items have variable numbers of usages and differing chances of triggering.  This can have a big impact on their value and their impact on the game.
