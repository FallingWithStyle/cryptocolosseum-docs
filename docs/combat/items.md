There are four different types of items.
The four categories (currently) are potions, scrolls, oils and dusts.

Some items help gladiators by increasing their stats or health.

Other items, often referred to as "curses", decrease their stats or health.

Note that any items applied are reset for each round within the tournament.  So a potion drunk during the first round is available again for the finals.
