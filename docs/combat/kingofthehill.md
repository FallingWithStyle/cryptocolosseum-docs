A pool of gladiators is selected ususally 6-8.
There is a random pairing of two and they fight.  (2500 PTG prize purse plus betting)
Then whoever wins is put back in the pool and the other gladiator is eliminated.

Two new gladiators are randonly paired.  (For now rolled in discord.)
A new grudge match of those two is created with a 2500 PTG prize purse and after a short amount of bidding that tournament is run.

This is repeated until there is only one gladiator left standing.
That gladiator's contract ownner recieves a 10000 PTG prize.

Our first ever King of the Hill Tournament will be the Top 7 Free Agent Gladiators by rank on August 13th.
