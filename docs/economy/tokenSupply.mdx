750M total supply.
* 100M for the DAO to operate (~ 4mm spent on migrating testnet users to mainnet).
    * The DAO's mission is to bring in more players to the Arena and to make the Crypto Colosseum more fun.
* 50M for new user incentives. Currently manifested as "1000 free PTG for signup!" Overtime this number will decrease.
* 300M for tournament incentives. Over the next 4 years tournament betting pools will be incentivized with additional PTG. Monthly's get the most, then weeklies then dailies.
* 300M for liquidity bootstrapping (more on this below).
