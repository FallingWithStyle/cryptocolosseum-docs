750M total supply.
* 100M for the DAO to operate (~ 4mm spent on migrating testnet users to mainnet).
    * The DAO's mission is to bring in more players to the Arena and to make the Crypto Colosseum more fun.
* 50M for new user incentives. Currently manifested as "1000 free PTG for signup!" Overtime this number will decrease.
* 300M for tournament incentives. Over the next 4 years tournament betting pools will be incentivized with additional PTG. Monthly's get the most, then weeklies then dailies.
* 300M for liquidity bootstrapping (more on this below).

## Liquidity Bootstrap
:::tip

More details to follow. The bootstrapper is current not released.

::: 

You can earn free PTG by providing liquidity to the protocol. Unlike other token farms the PTG bootstrap operates a little differently.

PTG liquidity is provided as pairs trading on [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/) (The polygon equivalent of Uniswap). You provide the other side of the pair and the liquidity bootstrapper will *give* you the otherside of your PTG for the pool. For instance if the pair is MATIC/PTG you need only to supply MATIC and the bootstrapper will give you PTG equivalent to the current price of PTG in the pool (minus a tiny but ever increasing fraction). However, the pool requires you lock your LP token for 3 months. Since you are being supplied fully 50% of the pair, your annualized APY is 300%.
