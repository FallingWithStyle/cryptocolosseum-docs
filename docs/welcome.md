### Crypto Colosseum is a game of degenerate gambling and whimsical violence.

Crypto Colosseum is a new style of blockchain game. It’s multiplayer, it’s casual, it’s crypto-economic, it’s enhanced by AI and (most importantly) it’s fun.

Twice daily, gladiators battle it out in the arena. They fight for factions (ETH, Polygon, BTC). The price movement of those factions influences the matches.

Players buy items and influence the match. They also wager on those battles.

* Collect and trade items.
* Purchase gladiator contracts for passive income.
* Purchases shares in factions for passive income.
* Farm your PTG for passive income.
