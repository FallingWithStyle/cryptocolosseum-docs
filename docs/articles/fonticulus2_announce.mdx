Visit https://fonticulus.cryptocolosseum.com/?network=matic for rewards. Read more [here](/economy/liquidity_mining).

### Traunch Two
* 10mm PTG available
* $MATIC/$PTG Pair
* 90 day lockup from time of deposit
* 80% $PTG provided (10% of send used to purchase PTG)

Traunch 1 of liquidity rewards filled up in 10 days without announcing outside our community. Traunch 2 is now available, and there will be quicker turn around between rounds from now on.

Traunch 2 works the same as traunch 1 (read more [here](./fonticulus_announce), [here](/economy/liquidity_mining)). The only difference is now 80% of the PTG side of your liquidity is provided for you.

When you send matic to fonticulus, it uses 10% of your send to buy PTG from the pool, then it deposits the rest into the liquidity pool and does the same lockup as before (90 days).

The new flow:
