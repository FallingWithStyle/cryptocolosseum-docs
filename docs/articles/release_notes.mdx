** EPIC Comebacks: **

| Date | Type  	| Change   	| Full Description  	| 
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| July 2, 2021 | New Item Release | BoomStix!  | Three new marketplace items, BoomStix were released.  A common, uncommon and rare.  They have 1 activation per match and either undermine the gladiators defense or give them a massive attack boost.  ~15% chance of activation per turn. |
| June 30, 2021 | Release | Venly Packs | Venly packs are an easy way for players to buy PTG especially in the US.  Bonus items are included in most packs.   After some delays new packs were released. https://venly.market/search?contractName=Crypto%20Colosseum  |
| June 29, 2021 | Defect | Prevent Double Bidding | Double Bid issue - During times of network slowness, if the player hits “submit” a second time they can accidentally double their intended bid!  This is now prevented.   |
| June 29, 2021 | Enhancement | New "Auction Needs Your Attention" tab | Players were unable to tell which auctions required an action on their part - Added a tab which shows any auctions the player has won or needs to retrieve their PTG if they lost.   |
