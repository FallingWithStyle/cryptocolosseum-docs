This documentation is a work in progress.
All statements are about the current state of the game and subject to change as the game evolves.

:::

There are daily tournaments and more elaborate weekly tournaments.  There are two daily tournaments six days a week, from Monday to Saturday.  They are held at the same time each day.

*** Tournament Structure ***

Each tournament has four participant gladiators and three matches.  All bets on those gladiators are pooled and then paid back out to the players that predicted the right overall winner.

In the "semi-finals," each gladiator is paired with one other.  The winner of each semi-finals match qualifies for the finals.  The gladiator that wins the finals match is declared the winner of the tournament.  There is only one winner for each tournament.

The winners of each daily tournament are eligible for the weekly "Qualifier Tournament" currently held each Wednesday.  Those will have a larger prize pool (currently 100k PTG).  Each weekly tournament's winner is then qualified for the next "Champion of Champions" tournament, which are held periodically throughout the year.  These are the pinnacle of achievement for a gladiator in the Crypto Colosseum world.

Occasionally, a special tournament such as a Free Agent tournament will be announced in addition to the standard tournament rotation.  The gladiator that wins the Free Agent tournament has their contract put up for auction!

Below you can find additional information about what different portions of the tournament page mean.

***Leagues***

There is one league at this time: the Emperor's League.

The Emperor's league is the pinnacle of competition of the Crypto Colosseum world.

Other leagues will evolve underneath the Emperor's league feeding their champions in and allowing relegated gladiators to win their way back to glory.
