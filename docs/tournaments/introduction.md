This documentation is a work in progress.

There are daily tournaments and more elaborate weekly tournaments.

There is one league at this time, the Emporer's League.
The Emporer's league is the pinnacle of competition of the Crypto Colosseum world.

Other leagues will evolve underneath the Emporer's league feeding their champions in and allowing relegated gladiators to win their way back to glory.
